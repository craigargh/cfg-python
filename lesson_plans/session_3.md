# Session Title: Logic and If Statements

Session No: 3
 
## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this session students will be able to:

- Identify Boolean data values
- Explain and combine logical operators to compare data values
- Apply if, else and elif Statements to control the flow of programs
- Build short games using randomisation


## Session Outline

Please do not change the intro and closing blocks - feel free to add more session blocks as you see fit.


## Intro & Framing

The teaching blocks and exercises in this session focus on logical operators and if statements. Students are first introduced to comparisons and boolean operators in isolation. After they have a good grasp on comparisons and boolean operators, they are shown how to combine them with if statements to automate decision making in their programs.

At the end of the session students can select one (or more) of three exercises that combine what they have learned in the session. These three exercises are in order of difficulty: 3.6 is intended for students that need more support, 3.7 for the average student, and 3.8 for students that are happy to take on more challenge. 

## Block 1: Logical Operators

??? minutes

This first part of this block introduces comparisons, such as equals (==) and less than (<). There is not enough time in the session to dedicate time to each comparison, so they are summarised in a table. 

Make sure you point out to students that `==` is used to compare values and `=` is to set variables, as this is a common mistake with students.

The second part of this block introduces the boolean operators `and`, `or`, and `not`. 

### Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 3.1: 5-10 minutes
- The scenario for this exercise is that the program needs to decide whether to go to a burger restaurant based on the price
- This exercise requires students to use a comparison to check whether a number they input is less than 10
- Students can refer to the previous example to help them with their code
- Make sure that students have a solution for this exercise as it will be used throughout the following exercises

Exercise 3.2: 3-5 minutes
- This exercise builds on the previous exercise
- The scenario is that the program needs to check whether the burger restaurant has a vegetarian option
- Students will need to add a second input and use the `and` opeartor to check whether the input meets two conditions
- Extension: Add an extra criteria that the restaurants rating needs to be more than 3 

## Block 2: If Statements

??? minutes

This next block introduces students to if statements. They are shown basic if statements that use a single comparison as well as those that combine multiple comparisons using Boolean operators.


### Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 3.3: 3-5 minutes
- This scenario requires students to adapt their earlier burger program to use an if statement to determine the output of the program
- 

## Block 3: Else Statements

3-5 minutes

This block builds on the previous one and introduces `else` statements. 


### Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 3.4: 5-10 minutes
- This exercise scenario requires students to create a bill calculator
- They will need to complete the code given in the exercise
- An if statement is used to apply a discount depending on user input

## Block 4: Elif Statements

??? minutes

This block introduces `elif` statements that are tied closely with `if` and `else`.

### Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 3.5: 10 minutes
- The scenario for this exercise is that the students are making a pizza and need to use if, elif and else to determine if the temperature is correct
- Extension: Ask at the start of the program whether you're cooking a cake or a pizza. The suggested temperatures for a cake should be different from the pizza.

## Block 5: Random

??? minutes

This final block introduce the random module in Python's standard library. The exercises in this block combine `if`, `else` and `elif` with the random module to create basic games of chance.

Students have a choice of three different exercises and should choose whichever exercise they feel comfortable attempting. The exercises are ordered by difficulty. 

Exercise 3.6 is for students that might need additional support, exercise 3.7 is for students that have made good progress, and exercise 3.8 is for students that want a more challenging exericse.

### Relevant Exercise(s):

Students should choose to complete one exercise, but can attempt others if they finish.

Exercise 3.6: 10-15 minutes
- This program is a basic heads-or-tails guessing game
- If the random coin flip matches the choice input by the user then they win
- If the random coin flip does not match the choice input by the user then they lose
- The students should use the code included in the exercise as a starting point
- Extension: The program should show a message to the user if they enter a choice that isn't heads or tails

Exercise 3.7: 10-15 minutes
- This program simulates rock-paper-scissors
- Students will need to use if, else and elif statements to complete the rest of the program
- Extension: the program should show a message to the user if they enter a choice that isn't rock, paper or scissors
- If the students finish this exercise, they should try to complete exercise 3.6 without copying the starter code

Exercise 3.8: 10-15 minutes
- This exercise is a simplified version of a roulette table
- The requirements of the program are listed in the exercise
- Some starter code for the random result is given in the exercise
