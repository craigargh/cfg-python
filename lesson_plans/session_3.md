# Session Title: Logic and If Statements

Session No: 3
 
## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this session students will be able to:

- Identify Boolean data values
- Explain and combine logical operators to check conditions
- Apply if, else and elif Statements to control the flow of programs
- Build short games using randomisation


## Session Outline

Please do not change the intro and closing blocks - feel free to add more session blocks as you see fit.


## Intro & Framing

The teaching blocks and exercises in this session focus on logical operators and if statements. Students are first introduced to comparisons and boolean operators in isolation. After they have a good grasp on comparisons and boolean operators, they are shown how to combine them with if statements to automate decision making in their programs.

At the end of the session students can select one (or more) of three exercises that combine what they have learned in the session. These three exercises are in order of difficulty: 3.6 is intended for students that need more support, 3.7 for the average student, and 3.8 for students that are happy to take on more challenge. 

## Block 1: Logical Operators

??? minutes

This first part of this block introduces comparisons, such as equals (==) and less than (<). There is not enough time in the session to dedicate time to each comparison, so they are summarised in a table. 

The second part of this block introduces the boolean operators `and`, `or`, and `not`. 

### Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 3.1: 5-10 minutes
- This exercise requires students to use a comparison to check whether a number they input is less than 10
- Students can refer to the previous example to help them with their code

Exercise 3.2: ??? minutes
- This exercise builds on the previous exercise
- Students will need to add a second input and use the `and` opeartor to check whether the input meets two conditions
- Extension: Add an extra criteria that the restaurants rating needs to be more than 3
