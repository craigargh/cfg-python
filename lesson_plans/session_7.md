## Intro & Framing

In this session students will work on their projects. At the start of the session try to check-in with each of the groups to check their progress. 

If you have time to organise it, the start of this session is an ideal time to have someone deliver a short (< 10 minutes) presentation about their work as a developer. Ideally the person giving the presentation should have a similar background to the students on the course.
