# Session Title: 8

Session No: Projects and Presentations
 
## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this session students will be able to:

- Build an application to meet the requirements of a project brief
- Design and implement extensions to the project
- Present and explain the finished team project to other students


## Session Outline

Please do not change the intro and closing blocks - feel free to add more session blocks as you see fit.


## Intro & Framing

This is the final session of the course. In the first half the students will have some time to finish off their projects.

In the second half of the session, the students will present their team projects to the rest of the students. There are is also a short section where the instructor will briefly cover careers that use Python and further resources that the students might find helpful.

If you have access to a projector for the student presentation, try to bring adapters for HDMI, displayport, mini-displayport, USB-C and whatever Macs use these days.

## Block 1: Projects

60 minutes

For this block students will continue working on their projects with the aim of having something to demonstrate to the rest of the group. 

Students should be advised that they shouldn't make drastic changes to their projects as they only have a limited amount of time before their presentations. Instead they should focus on making sure that the project works and improving small parts of the project.

### Relevant Exercise(s):

N/A

## Block 2: Student Presentations

40 minutes (depending on the number of groups)

In this block students will present their projects to the rest of the group. Presentations should last 5 minutes at most, with an additional few minutes for 2-3 questions from other students and intructors.

Student presentations don't require a lot of preparation from the students. They don't need to prepare slides. Suggestions for what the presentations could include:

- What was the original plan for the project?
- What does the project actually do?
- A brief explanation of an interesting piece of code in the project
- One thing that the students learned during the project
- A difficult part of the project that the students overcame
- What would the students do if they had more time on the project

Politely ask students not to work on their projects while others are presenting.

After all of the presentations are complete, ask the students to vote on which they want to win the course prize. Feel free to use an alternative method for judging the course prize if you want (e.g. instructor judged criteria like code quality). 

Don't put too much emphasis on the competition. Make sure you sincerely congratulate everyone on what they've achieved. Remind them that they started the course having no knowledge of programming and have come so far. Throughout the course some students may have really struggled with certain things, but they percevered. 

### Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 8.1: 5 minutes per team
- Students will present their projects

## Block 3: Careers and Further Resouces

In this block you'll briefly cover Python career paths and additional resources for students. While you are presenting this part, have another instructor count the votes for the project competition.

## Block 4: Closing

5 minutes

This is the final part of the course. Announce the winners of the project competition.

Remember to congratulate everyone as well as give the instructors a round of applause for all of their support during the course.

Ask the students to complete the course feedback form before they leave.
