# Session Title: Input, Loops and Functions with Turtle

Session No: 2
 
## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this session students will be able to:

- Construct programs that use user input
- Describe the purpose of Python libraries
- Solve problems to create drawings using the Turtle library
- Modify duplicated code to use for Loops 
- Construct reusable functions


## Session Outline

Please do not change the intro and closing blocks - feel free to add more session blocks as you see fit.


## Intro & Framing

This session focuses on repetition and reusabilitiy in code. Students will be introduced to the following Python programming concepts:

- Use input
- Libraries
- For loops
- Functions

Several of the exercises require the students to develop problem solving skills in order to create basic shapes and drawings using the Python turtle library.


## Block 1: User Input

4-5 minutes

The first block introduces students to the `input()` function. Time should be taken to show students where PyCharm expects you to enter user input.

4-5 minutes

The second half of the block introduces the `int()` function which can be used to convert the string value entered in `input()` to an integer. When demonstrating the example show what happens when you enter text instead of a number and explain the error message.

### Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 2.1: 5 minutes
- In this exercise students will practice using the `input()` function
- They need to come up with their owns questions and use string formatting from the first session to format the output
-  Students should be encouraged to adapt the example shown in the exercise description

Exercise 2.2: 5 minutes
- This exercise introduces the use of `int()` when used in combination with `input()`
- Students should use the code in the exercise as a starting point for their solutions

## Block 2: Python Libraries

3 minutes

This block explains the purpose of Python libraries i.e. reusable code that someone else has written that you can use. This lesson uses the turtle module in the standard library. The Python Package Index (PyPI) is introduced in a later session.
