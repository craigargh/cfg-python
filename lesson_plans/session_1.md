# Session Title: Data Types and Variables 

Session No: 1
 
## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this session students will be able to:

- Understand the differences and uses of Python files and the Python console
- Recognise the integer, float and string data types
- Identify different maths operations and their effects
- Locate key information on error messages
- Explain what a variable is and how they are used
- Demonstrate basic problem solving


## Session Outline

Please do not change the intro and closing blocks - feel free to add more session blocks as you see fit.


## Intro & Framing

This session provides a gentle introduction to the fundamentals of Python. Students will learn about:

- Python files and the Python console
- Data types (integers, floats, and strings)
- Maths operations
- Error messages 
- Variables

Before the start of the session the students are expected to have installed PyCharm and Python 3. A small amount of time should be available at the start of the session to support students that were unsuccessful with installation.

## Block 1: Introduction to the Course


## Block 2: Your First Python Program


### Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 1.1: 4 minutes
- This exercise gives the students a chance to explore their first program
- Use this time to support students that were unable to run their first program
- Briefly question the students that changed the program and ask them to share what happened


## Block 3: Number Data Types and Operators

2 minutes

This block introduces the integer and float data types along with maths operators.

The Python console is used in this exercise. The instructor should walk students through the locating the Python console and executing a Python statement.

### Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 1.2: 3-5 minutes
- The students will explore different maths operators using the Python shell
- They should be able to identify the purpose of each opeartor.
- Ask different students to share with the rest of the class what each operator does after they have completed the exercise

## Block 4: The Python Console

3-5 minutes

This block is a brief explanation of when it is appropriate to use the Python console and when it is appropriate to use files.

## Block 5: String Data Type

In this block students are introduced to the string data type along with common mistakes when using strings. 

Explain an error message so that students can better understand them when debugging their own programs. Instructors should bring attention to:
1. The line number
1. The error type (e.g. NameError)
1. The error message (e.g. "name 'hello' is not defined")

Throughout the course when assisting students with error messages one-to-one, get the student to identify these three things to help them explain the problem.


### Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 1.3: 5 minutes
- Students will explore different methods and operations with strings
- Get the students to share what each line does, first with a partner, then as a pair with the rest of the group
- Students that make more progress should try to identify why the error message occurred  


## Block 6: Variables

Variables are introduced in this block. Students are also given their first exercise to write a more complex program that combines integers, maths operations, strings and variables.

## Relevants Exercises(s):

Exercise 1.4: 10-15 minutes
- Students need to create a program that calculates how many cans of cat food are needed to feed 10 cats
- The exercise combines all of the things that they have learned up to this point
- Students can refer back to the oranges calculator example on the previous slide
- Extension: students should modify the program to calculate how many cans are needed for seven days


## Block 7: String Formatting

This block focuses on string formatting using Python's .format() method. Comments are also mentioned.

## Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 1.5: 5-8 minutes
- Students will modify their cat food calculator's output to use the .format() method
- Hint: Students can refer back to the previous slide for guidance


## Recap & Closing
How can you get the learners to articulate what they learned today, celebrate what they achieved and inform them what they need to do as homework?



## Homework Tasks

Learning Task: 
Which exercise will help all students recap what they have learnt and prepare for the next session?


Extended Learning Task:
