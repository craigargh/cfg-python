# Session Title: Variables and Data Types

Session No: 1
 
## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this session students will be able to:

- Understand the differences and uses of Python files and the Python console
- Recognise the integer, float and string data types
- Indentify different maths operations and their effects
- Locate key information on error messages
- Explain what a variable is and how they are used
- Demonstrate basic problem solving


## Session Outline

Please do not change the intro and closing blocks - feel free to add more session blocks as you see fit.


## Intro & Framing

This session provides a gentle introduction to the fundamentals of Python. Students will learn about:

- Python files and the Python console
- Data types (integers, floats, and strings)
- Maths operations
- Error messages 
- Variables

Before the start of the session the students are expected to have installed PyCharm and Python 3. A small amount of time should be available at the start of the session to support students that were unsuccessful with installation.

## Block 1: Introduction to the Course


## Block 2: Your First Python Program

5 minutes

As a group the instructor walks the students through creating a new Python file and running it in PyCharm. The students should follow each step as the instructor demonstrates it.

### Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 1.1: 4 minutes
- This exercise gives the students a chance to explore their first program
- You can use this time to support students that were unable to run their first program
- Question the students that changed the program and get them to share what happened


## Block 3: The Python Console

3-5 minutes

The Python console is an alternative way to run Python programs. The instructor will walk students through the locating the Python console and executing a Python statement.


## Block 4: Number Data Types and Operators

2 minutes

This block introduces the integer and float data types along with maths operators

### Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 1.2: 5 minutes
- The students will explore different maths operators using the Python shell
- They should be able to identify the purpose of each opeartor.
- Ask different students to share with the rest of the class what each operator does after they have completed the exercise

## Block 5: String Data Type

In this block students are introduced to the string data type along with common mistakes when using strings. 

The instructor will explain an error message so that students can better understand them when debugging their own programs. Instructors should bring attention to:
1. The line number
1. The error type (e.g. NameError)
1. The error message (e.g. "name 'hello' is not defined")

Throughout the course when assisting students with error messages one-to-one, get the student to identify these three things to help them explain the problem.


### Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 1.3: 5 minutes
- Students will explore different methods and operations with strings
- Get the students to share what each line does, first with their partner, then as a pair with the rest of the group
- Students that make more progress should try to identify why the error message occurred  


## Block 6: Variables

Variables are introduced in this block. Students are also given their first exercise to write a more complex program that combines integers, maths operations, strings and variables.

## Relevants Exercises(s):

Exercise 1.4: 10-15 minutes
- Students need to create a program that calculates how many cans of cat food are needed to feed 10 cats
- This is the students' first longer exercise
- The exercise combines all of the things that they have learned up to this point
- Hint: Students can refer back to the oranges calculator example on the previous slide
- Extension: students should modify the program to calculate how many cans are needed for seven days


## Block 7: String Formatting

This block focuses on string formatting using Python's .format() method. Comments are also mentioned.

## Relevant Exercise(s):

Exercise 1.5: 5-8 minutes
- Students will modify their cat food calculator's output to use the .format() method
- Hint: Students can refer back to the previous slide for guidance


## Recap & Closing
How can you get the learners to articulate what they learned today, celebrate what they achieved and inform them what they need to do as homework?

Recap questions:
- If I wanted to write a program that I will run multiple times, should I use the Python console or a Python file?
- What are the three data types that we learned about today?
- 


## Homework Tasks

Learning Task: 
Which exercise will help all students recap what they have learnt and prepare for the next session?


Extended Learning Task:
Which exercise will help students push their learning from today a step further?
