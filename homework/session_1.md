# Homework: Session 1

## Question 1

I have written the following Python program to work out how many pizza slices I need to buy for my friends.

```python
people = '15'
pizza_slices = 4

total_pizza_slices = people * pizza_slices

message = 'I need to buy {} pizza slices'.format(total_pizza_slices)

print(message)
```

When I run the program it tells me that I need to buy 15151515 slices of pizza. This seems like a lot of pizza.

Is my program calculating the total number of slices correctly? What is the problem? How do I fix it?
