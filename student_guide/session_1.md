# Exercises

## Session 1

**Exercise 1.1:** Now that you've run your first program, try the following:

- Change the message to anything you want
- Add different characters/symbols to the message
- Output multiple messages in the same file
- Find out what happens when they remove different parts of the code (e.g. brackets)

Don't worry if something unexpected happens. Think about what you changed and why it might have caused it to happen.

**Exercise 1.2:** Type these lines into your **Python console**:

```python
5 - 6
8 * 9
6 / 2
5 / 0
5.0 / 2
5 % 2
2 * (10 + 3)
2 ** 4
```

What does each one do and what is its output?

Are there any outputs you didn't expect?

---

**Exercise 1.3:**

In your **Python console** type each of these

```python
"Cat"
"Cat" + " videos"

"Cat" * 3
"Cat" + 3

"Cat".upper()
"Cat".lower()

"the lord of the rings".title()
```

What is the output for each one and why?

One of them causes an exception. Read the exception message. What do you think it means?

---

**Exercise 1.4:**: In a new Python **file** called `cat_food.py`, create a program that calculates how many cans of cat food you need to feed 10 cats

Your will need:
1. A **variable** for the number of **cats**
1. A **variable** for the number of **cans** each cat eats in a day
1. A `print()` function to output the result

**Extension:** change the calculation to work out the amount needed for 7 days

---

**Exercise 1.5:** Rewrite `cat_food.py` to use string formatting instead of joining strings with `+`.

An example of string formatting:

```python
user_name = 'sarah_1987'
age = 23

output = '{} is {} years old'.format(user_name, age)
print(output)
```
