----

This session
1. Planning your project
1. Doing your project
1. git (optional)

---

### Planning Requirements

----

When you start a new project you may have lots of ideas on what it could do.

In this session we'll cover a technique called MoSCoW to prioritise your ideas.

----

**Task:** If you have an idea, give a brief description to the rest of the students

Get together in groups of 2-3 people

----

**Task:** Get together with your group. As a single sentence write a very brief summary of what the project will do.

For example: 

> A website where you can search for books

----

**Task:** Next, write down all of things that you think your project could do. 

Don't worry if an idea sounds stupid or too difficult at this stage. Just get as many ideas as possible.

----

For example:
- Users should be able to enter the book's name in a search box
- The price of the book should be shown on the search results
- The user should be able to order the book from Amazon
- The author of the book should be shown in the search results
- The book's front cover should be shown in the search results

----

MoSCoW is a technique for prioritising requirements. 

You put your requirements into four groups:
- Must
- Should
- Could
- Won't

----

**Task:** Group your ideas using MoSCoW

The instructors will review these with you and help you prioritise 5 things that you should aim to complete by the next session

----

**Task:** Look for APIs that you might be able to use for your projects. Some common APIs will have beginner friendly tutorials

> You can find tutorials by searching for something like `Spotify API Python beginner tutorial`


---

### Git

----

Version/source control is useful when working as part of a team.

Git is the most widely used source control software.

GitHub is a website that allows you to host Git repositories.

----

A Git repository stores the versions of your application's code in a single location.
