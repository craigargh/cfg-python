#### Python Session 3

----

This session:
1. Logical Operators
1. If Statements

---

### Logical Operators

----

**Bolean:** A data-type that is either `True` or `False`

**Logical Operators:** compare values to determine wheter something is `True` or `False`

----

This code checks if the user has input `'Monday'` using the `==` operator

```python
today = input('What day is it? ')

is_monday = today == 'Monday'

print('Today is Monday: {}'.format(is_monday))
```

----

Operators in Python

Name | Python
---|---
Equal to | `==`
Not equal | `!=`
Greater than | `>`
Less than | `<`
Greater than or equal | `>=`
Less than or equal | `<=`

----

This code checks if the current temperature is freezing:

```python
temperature = input('What is the temperature? ')

is_freezing = int(temperature) <= 0

print('The temperature is freezing: {}'.format(is_freezing))
```

----

**Exercise 3.1:** You have a budget of Â£10 and want to write a program to decide which burger restaurant to go to.

1. Input the `price` of a burger using `input()`
1. Check whether the `price` is less than or equal (`<=`) `10.00`
1. Print the result in the format below

```bash
Burger is within budget: True
```

**Hint:** remember to convert the input from a string to a decimal with `float()`

----

Answer

```python
price = input('How much is a burger? ')

within_budget = float(price) <= 10.00

print('Burger is within budget: {}'.format(within_budget))
```

----

There are operators to combine multiple checks

Python | What it does
---|---
and | both expressions are `True`
or | at least one expression is `True`
not | reverse the expression (`True` becomes `False` and vice-versa)

----

This program will work out if you should visit Mars based on whether you want to visit and if you can afford it:

```python
mars_choice = input('Would you like to visit Mars? y/n')
is_willing = mars_choice == 'y'

affordable = input('Can you afford to visit Mars? y/n')
can_afford = affordable == 'y'

should_visit_mars = is_willing and can_afford

print('You should visit Mars: {}'.format(should_visit_mars))
```
----

**Exercise 3.2:** Add code to your burger program to input whether the restaurant has a vegetarian option

The output should say whether the cost is within budget **AND** has a vegetarian option

```bash
Restaurant meets criteria: True
```

----

Solution:

```python
price = input('How much is a burger? ')
vegetarian = input('Is there a vegetarian option? (y/n) ')

within_budget = float(price) <= 10.00
has_vegetarian = vegetarian == 'y'

is_good_choice = within_budget and has_vegetarian

print('Restaurant meets criteria: {}'.format(is_good_choice))
```

---

### If Statements

----

**if statement:** used to run a block of code depending on whether a condition is `True` or `False`

----

```python
password = input('password: ')

if password == 'jumanji':
    print('Success!')

```

----

An `if` statement has the following:
1. The `if` keyword
1. A condition (logical operator expression)
1. A colon
1. Body (indented four spaces)

----

This program checks whether you are an admin and you have entered the right password:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
is_admin = name == 'admin'

password = input("What is your password? ")
is_password_correct = password == 'dinosaurs'

if is_admin and is_password_correct:
    print('Welcome')

if not is_admin or not is_password_correct:
    print('Go away')
```

----

**Exercise 3.3:** Rewrite the output of your burger program to use if statements

Depending on the input the output should be:

```bash
This restaurant is a great choice!
```

Otherwise it should be:

```bash
Probably not a good idea
```

---

### Else Statements

----

**else statement:** Used with an `if` statement and will run when the `if` condition is `False`


----

```python
password = input('password: ')

if password == 'jumanji':
    print('Success!')
else:
    print('Failure!')

```

----

Here's the admin program rewritten to use `else`:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
is_admin = name == 'admin'

password = input("What is your password? ")
is_password_correct = password == 'dinosaurs'

if is_admin and is_password_correct:
    print('Welcome')

else:
    print('Go away')
```

----

**Exercise 3.4:**

```python
???
```

---


### Elif Statements
----

**Exercise ???:** Rock, scissors, paper

```python
import random


def random_choice():
    choice_number = random.randint(1, 3)

    if choice_number == 1:
        choice = 'rock'
    elif choice_number == 2:
        choice = 'scissors'
    else:
        choice = 'paper'

    return choice

my_choice = input('Choose rock, scissors or paper: ')
opponent_choice = random_choice()

print('You opponent chose {}'.format(opponent_choice))

if my_choice = 'rock' and opponent_choice == 'scissors':
    print('You win!')
```
