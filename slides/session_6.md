### Planning Requirements

----

When you start a new project you may have lots of ideas on what it could do.

In this session we'll cover a technique called MoSCoW to prioritise your ideas.

----

**Task:** Get together with your group. As a single sentence write a very brief summary of what the project will do.

For example: 

> A website where you can search for books

----

**Task:** Next, write down all of things that you think your project could do. 

Don't worry if an idea sounds stupid or too difficult at this stage. Just get as many ideas as possible.

----

For example:
- Users should be able to enter the book's name in a search box
- The price of the book should be shown on the search results
- The user should be able to order the book from Amazon
- The author of the book should be shown in the search results
- The book's front cover should be shown in the search results

----

MoSCoW is a technique for prioritising requirements. 

You put your requirements into four groups:
- Must
- Should
- Could
- Won't

----

**Task:** Group your ideas using MoSCoW
