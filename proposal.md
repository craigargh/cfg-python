Remove Flask
- Beginners course so no html experience

Spend more time on fundamentals and exercises
- Course currently misses a lot of content due to time restrictions
- 

Give a choice of pre-written project briefs:
- Narrows the scope (easier for students and instructors)
- More focus on problem solving with Python
- No Flask/HTML
- Interaction through `input()`
